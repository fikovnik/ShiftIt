*Fikovnik's Mac Toolkit*

A collection of utility classes and functions that I share across project. Some documentation is in the header files, but most of the time the names of the methods and functions are pretty self-explanatory. Here's the list of current functionalities:

* `FMTHotkeys*` - manager and hot key class that allows for simple management of global hotkeys, compatible with the [ShortcutRecorder][1]
* `FMTLoginItems` - manage the list of system/session wide login items
* `FMTDefines` - basic assert and log macros (inspired by the [google-mac-toolbox][2])
* `FMTUtils` - some additional utility functions that might be handy
